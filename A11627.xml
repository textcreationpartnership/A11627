            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In this continuall courſe Mutation ſo prevaileth upon ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding generations, that as they are diſtant from the firſt times, they decline from primitiue innocencie, and as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb facs="tcp:21547:3"/>
to the later dayes, they participate of their evils. Yea ſo forcible is Defection (the daughter of this Mutation) in the congregations of the faithfull, that the vacant places of the righteous departed are ſeldome or never filled againe, their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours followeth them, and they are forgotten. If the kirk bee in Aegypt, Ioſeph dieth, and there ariſeth a new king there who knew not Ioſeph. When the people enters into the land, Ioſua and that generation is gathered to their fathers, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generation ariſeth up after them which neither knoweth the Lord, nor the works which he had done for Iſrael by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Ioſua, in Aegypt, at the red ſea, in the wilderneſſe, and at the entrance into the promiſed land. And in the land it ſelfe, after Athaliahs troubles Ioaſh, whoſe life was ſaved by Iehoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada, and in whoſe dayes he did that which was righteous in the ſight of the Lord, after his death h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arkneth to the Princes who make obeyſance to the King, and leaving the houſe of the Lord God of their fathers, ſerve idols, but Ioaſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth not the kindneſſe done by Iehoiada, but ſlayeth his ſonne.</p>
            <p>As by theſe ſtrange alterations fearfull eclipſes were brought upon the face of common honeſty, likely to baniſh religion out of the earth, ſo under the ends of the world ſurpaſſing the preceeding generations in loue decayed, and iniquitie multiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, if it were not the rich mercy and undeſerved loue of the Lord not to ſuffer the rod of the wicked to reſt upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lot of the righteous, but now and then in the middeſt of confuſions brought on by Mutation, to refreſh them under the ſweet ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of peace and proſperitie, the very elect could hardly eſcape. If adverſitie beare the ſway, the people of God are in hazard to put out their hands to evill: and if proſperitie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, then the kingdome of heaven is likened unto a man who ſowed good ſeed in his field, but while men ſlept, his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie came and ſowed tares among the wheat, which may not be gathered up till the harveſt, leſt the wheat alſo be rooted up with them. When the Lord his field ſhall be once infected with ſuch venemous mixture of falſe teachers, &amp; their fooliſh diſciples, renouncing their own libertie, &amp; ſlaviſhly ſubmitting
<pb facs="tcp:21547:3"/>
themſelues without triall to follow their ſeducers in laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes and avarice for atchieving their own vitious hopes, if Iſrael were not poured from veſſel to veſſel, they ſhould freeze upon their dreggs like Moab, &amp; ſo looſe not only their come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly countenance, but the health and life of their ſubſtantiall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: the deceitful colours of theſe ſupervenient weeds ſo daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the eyes of the common ſort, for the moſt part more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall then ſpirituall, and either vailed with black ignorance, or blind hypocriſie, that religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in her natiue ſimplicitie &amp; purity ſeemeth to them an handmaid rather then a miſtres, if ſhe bee not busked with ſome new guiſe of one alteration or other.</p>
            <p>In this change, if a Prieſt or a Levit, or any of the ancient ſhall happen to weep for the firſt Temple, by the meanes of mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thus d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There ariſeth no ſmall ſtirre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that way, whole cities are filled with confuſion, and the cry goeth up for the Diana of the time. If Paul himſelfe were gotten, he would not paſſe with <hi>peſtilent fellow,</hi> but ſtone him to the death before he be heard; yea when the furie of Mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inflameth the minds of Barbarians, if they ſee a viper of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity on a mans hand, they ſay ſurely he is a murtherer, and if no inconvenience follow, he is a God. So madly are the hearts of men ſet in them, privily to blind themſelues with the beams of their own particulars, and the world with open ſhew of ſeeming zeale for juſtice and religion.</p>
            <p>The toyles &amp; toſſings of theſe Circaean changes, are ever ſo unſavourie to a man of a quiet ſpirit, that if the wronged inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie of a juſt cauſe, ſhameleſſe violence done to the rights &amp; priviledges of religion, and the intolerable pride practiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt famous kirks vnheard, could be cloſed up in any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſilence, honeſt men knowing very well that the railings of reprochers never woundeth a good conſcience, could rather chooſe to ſuſtaine a legion of bitter aſperſions, for peace to preach the Goſpell, then either to interrupt their owne tranquilitie, or giue the leaſt cauſe of ſuſpition to any,

that they were brought from the ſweet courſe of their pure, peaceable, and ſimple wiſedome, to contend for their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fame and reputation, and ſo to hinder the preaching of Chriſt. For what matter is it though men be deſpiſed, diſgraced and ſcorned, ſo long as the Lord may bee honoured thereby. But when the night of ſecuritie ſhall bee ſo dark, and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pride aſcend to ſuch a height, that not onely the lower ſort, but men of great ſpirits and places can with a deafe eare paſſe by the wrongs done to ſincere profeſſours, faithfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and martyrs of good memorie, but by a ſort of bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh patience, ſuffer a ſubſtantiall truth to be borne down, and blaſphemed, and for a forlorne tradition, or worm-eaten cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie ſhamefully ſhot forth; yea a ſetled forme of godlineſſe by long and happy experience univerſally approved, to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed for far-fetched devices of needleſſe novelties; and the beſt ſubiects, walking in knowledge of their dutie, &amp; conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious converſation, without any juſt cauſe openly traduced, that they are not Caeſars friends, in a falſe policie to make the righteous cauſe odious to authoritie.

in mens owne perſons, hurled in againe to be the wall and tower of new Epiſcopacie, cunningly brought in by her Intrant the conſtant Moderator, and ſolemnly ſet up to remain the Atlas of their kingdome, with full power of Lordly domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be exerciſed over the kirk for the fiue Articles, the fundamentall lawes of that uſurped authoritie, and to put forth and hold forth the lawfull and neceſſarie aſſemblies of the kirk, as enemies to the power of Princes. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily both reaſon and experience making plaine, that the kings of the earth were never preſſed downe with any lawfull aſſembly Eccleſiaſticall or any way diſſeyſed of kirk Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, with which the Lord originally had poſſeſſed them: but Epiſcopacie, as time hath favoured her inſatiable deſires, by diſpoſſeſſing and bringing downe both kings and kirks, hath ſet up and holdeth up Papiſtrie, ever evill maſters, like fire and water, but never better ſervants then treacherous ſlaues lying in wait to oppreſſe their maſters.</p>
            <p>It may be that the Patrones and urgers of this courſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly aime not at the reducing of Papiſtrie, and for any thing yet known, charitie would they ſhould not bee miſdeemed in that groſſe ſinne. Nevertheleſſe, as a certaine learned man ſayth of ſome of the Ancients, that unwittingly, and againſt their wills, they made a way for Antichriſt: ſo it may be feared of ſome ſo diligent to catch occaſions, by envy to exclude and degrade them that are good and painfull, and ſo ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their own fault, that rather then they wil leaue them, they paine themſelues to deviſe how to raiſe up troubles in the kirk, and driue men from it into conventicles and corners, very farre different from the wiſe Pilot, vvhen the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt inforceth, emptieth the ſhip of ſome things to ſaue the reſt, but they caſt out the Pilots of the ſhips themſelues, to ſaue theſe Romiſh wares, trifles and cuſtomes, as they tearme them: and againe ſo negligent to cenſure great corruptions in ſuch as are praiſed for their readineſſe to admit by implicit faith whatſoever is offered, and to ſtand in contention about mens traditions, likely to ſay the kirk waſte.

thus to uphold their owne Lordſhips over Gods heritage, they preſſe their own traditions more then the weightier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the law, the practiſe of the ceremonie more then the obſervation of the Lords day, kneeling at the receiving of the ſacrament out of the Miniſters hand, more then the catechiſing of the people, and true meaning of the Lords inſtitution, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the conforme hypocrite, ignorant or ſenceleſſe, aboue the wiſe Chriſtian rooted and grounded in the Goſpell, they giue a great hope to the limbs of Antichriſt to ſettle their tottering kingdome, and a more eaſie entrance for the whole body of abhominations, then they are aware of. England feeleth and feareth already, and Scotland hath cauſe to faſt and pray, that the opinion &amp; practiſe of theſe ceremonies may be removed as farre from them, as busking and balling ſhould be from chaſt women. It is a prodigious preſage, that ſtatutes ſuch as they are, and procured as they were in favours of dangerous novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhould be more vehemently urged, and with greater rigor put in execution againſt the true ſervants of God for modeſt adherence to a truth never condemned, and for refuſall of needleſſe rites never proved to be lawful by Gods word, nor by any good appearance like to proue profitable, then all the good ſtatutes ſtanding in force againſt idolatry and Idolaters, blaſphemers and murtherers, &amp; open contemners of the Lords word and his ſervice, as if the whole obedience of a Chriſtian ſubiect were incloſed in the practiſe of certain rites juſtly caſt forth of this kirk in the ignominious duſt of other errours: or Chriſtian charity were confined to the divided brotherhoood of indifferent things..</p>

Theſe ſlanderous calumnies are like a thorn ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the hand of a drunkard; it is hard to judge whom they ſhall hurt.

To burie them in ſilence had been their beſt condition, but when all meanes are ſought to make the faithfull even to ſtink among the inhabitants of the land, it can no wiſe beſeeme the miniſteriall calling to ſecret the truth, and by a cowardly kind of modeſtie to betray a good cauſe malitiouſly wounded through the ſides of honeſt men, craftily burdened with ſcandalls for bearing down their cauſe in a dangerous time. When ſo many not onely commons in the profeſſion, and novices in the miniſterie, but ſome great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors fall away no leſſe from their wonted faithfulneſſe, then from the ancient order whereby they were kept in the courſe of their miniſterie, are now by the force of time become other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded, undertaking by their publick teaching and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, by their private conference, and all other meanes, not onely to perſwade this new conformitie ſo farre contrarie to the forme whereunto they were delivered, but alſo with great hate, and unkindly carriage to their brethren and old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

            <p>There is here from a ready minde and a good will, the wiſe mans aneugh, a word of peace and puritie loſſed, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie found, and Conformitie urged, to hold out old V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, to inlarge affected indifferencie, and to ſet up the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of abſolute Conformitie in the ſtately chaires of both kirk and kingdome. The full hiſtorie and ample treatiſe of
<pb facs="tcp:21547:7"/>
the birth, education, and high promotion of this reſpected couple Indifferencie and Conformitie, with the controverſies brought in Scotland, and increaſed thereby, requireth larger volumnes then any Aurelius of this time will bee nicknamed <hi>Pupillus</hi> for neceſſarie charges to ſuch a work, while better oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. This Scotized conformitie for the preſent muſt ſtand at the paines of Archippus and Epaphras, two honeſt Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, and venturing themſelues upon the ſtage to bee glowred upon by every evill eye, or rather caſting themſelues upon thornes, to be gored by every ſharpe tongue. They are both good Patrons where ever they be. Archippus muſt take heed to the miniſterie which he hath received of the Lord, that hee fulfill it, and Epaphras a ſervant of Chriſt laboureth fervently for you in prayers, and by all meanes that you may ſtand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compleat in all the will of God. Archippus deſirous to ſtrengthen himſelfe by learning, and Epaphras ready to lay out his Talent to exchange, haue diligently ſurvayed the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Kirk of Scotland concerning the forenamed parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, &amp; painfully ſearched the doctrine of indifferent things, ſhooting up in a ſhort abridgement their beſt obſervations for preſent uſe, and clearly ſhewing, how conformitie came in by little and little without feeling, like Poperie comming to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by Ceremoniouſneſſe and Ambition, the ceremonies furniſhing her with a ſeeming beautie to allure, and Ambition an vnreſiſtable power to afray. They intend no way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge or extinguiſh the worthy volumes of the learned, but rather to ſpurre men of good conſcience, and meet gifts to ſearch and ſet forth fully and in perfect order theſe worthy purpoſes according to their great zeale to a ſound religion ſo long profeſſed, and by the bleſſing of God upon their labours, to gain ſuch as reſpecting their conſcience more then their credit, with vertues tincture ſhall bluſh after the ſight of the evill they haue committed, with hearty repentance turning their praiſe of men to the praiſe of God to their ioy and comfort, as Auguſtines Retractations are the glorie and crowne of all his writings. So much the rather as the cauſes of their yeelding haue been, in ſome lack of acquaintance &amp; ſight
<pb facs="tcp:21547:7"/>
of the matters in queſtion: in others ſimplicity, preſuming that nothing would be required, but that which they might ſafely yeeld unto: in a third ſort, a deſire to be imployed in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the kirk, thinking it more eaſie to beare theſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then to abide rigour: and a fourth ſort deceived by poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, thinking that their yeelding with proteſtation ſhould limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to them the ordinarie forme whereunto others are tied, without altering at leaſt in many inconveniences that may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue upon the obedience required. It were a worke of ſingular loue to help ſuch, and many others under the reſtraints of feare and other infirmities, who undoubtedly, if they were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to uſe their own libertie without hazarding themſelues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pikes of the law, would with great joy returne to their beſt beloved profeſſion, and by their happy repentance quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring to confuſion the reioycing of Papiſts &amp; Atheiſts, bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Miniſters and profeſſours to their faces, and ſaying plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they hope ere it be long, to ſee them all either come to them, or come to nothing. But feare them not, they are lying Prophets, evill men and ſeducers they are, and ſhall wax worſe and worſe, deceiving and being deceived: but continue thou in the things that thou haſt learned, and been aſſured of.</p>
            <p>In this caſe of good Chriſtians falling by infirmitie, &amp; proud enemies bragging of their hopes, let it not be thought ſtrange, that the louers of the primitiue beautie of the reformed kirk, earneſtly wiſh to haue it reſtored againe, and for that cauſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly ſhrink at a new ſtatute ſtanding in the contrary. Firſt, he breaks the band of obedience, ſayth one, who doth it without cauſe. If the refuſers haue not alledged cauſes iuſtifiable in the conſciences of any, who will debate the matter between God and their own ſoules, let them be better taught.

they would gladly return thereunto. Againe, it is granted, that the kirk of Scotland hath uſed ſince the reformation of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to celebrate the holy communion to the people ſitting, where the true reaſon moving them ſo to do, viz. <hi>(The table of the Lord is then moſt rightly miniſtred, when it approcheth moſt neer to Chriſt his own action: but plain it is at that ſupper Chriſt Jeſus ſate with his diſciples: and therfore do we iudge that ſitting at a table as moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to that holy action)</hi> is omitted, and another convoyed in, to wit (by reaſon of the great abuſe of kneeling vſed in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous worſhip of the ſacraments by the Papiſts) which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhould be granted to be a reaſon of very great weight. But how weak a removall of this reaſon is inſert in the act to caſt out ſitting and bring in kneeling, let them declare in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, that haue changed upon ſuch a reaſon, and urge others to doe the like, if all memorie of by-paſt ſuperſtition be paſſed out of Scotland, or if it be not rather renued and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But in theſe matters for good reaſons, men muſt ſparingly ſpeak. 3. It hath never been, neither can be proved by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Magiſtrates commandement ſimply and nakedly conſidered, without ſome warrant of the word of God, can be reputed a true ſpirituall guide to lead the conſcience of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in a matter of religion, or action of Gods worſhip in ſuch aſſurance, that he may ſay in the preſence of God, my opinion is ſound, and action acceptable, becauſe the magiſtrate hath commanded it, men being aſſured that Magiſtrates may erre in their iniunctions; and aſſemblies convened by the kings maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties authoritie, may command and inact things unlawfull and unprofitable. Ask the ſcripture, whether ever the good Kings among the Iewes, or elſe where, brought in any ſpeciall action or ceremony into the ſervice of God, without ſome ſpeciall warrant from himſelf, or whether they did deviſe ought, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the devices of eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies in their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and impoſe the one or the other upon the Levits, or upon any bearing office in the ſanctuarie, reſtraining them from their publick function without obedience to it; or whether ever by any of the meſſengers of God, the people were taught, that for the outward form and circumſtance of Gods worſhip, a civill
<pb facs="tcp:21547:8"/>
ſtatute or conſtitution of the kirk, without further ſearching of the ſcriptures, might be their ground, upon which they might build their obedience unto God, without further inquirie. 4. It is a received rule of Chriſtian libertie, at leaſt ſhould be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed kirkes, that the ordinances of the kirke are preſented unto Paſtors and people, not with neceſſitie of beleeving, but with libertie of trying, according to the rule, <hi>Try the ſpirits.</hi> It is the Lords own priviledge, that his iniunctions are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without queſtioning. It is likewiſe permitted by royall proviſion, that where the law was otherwiſe, men may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly content themſelues ſoberly &amp; quietly with their owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but alſo preſſe by patience, and well-grounded reaſons either to perſwade all the reſt to like of their judgements, or where they ſee better grounds to incline thereto. It is the part of a temporizing hypocrite, of the ſervant of men, and not of the ſervant of God, to frame their actions to that which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded without any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience of a truth, whether they know it or not, polluting the world with a brutiſh obedience, whiles without any reaſon in him that obeyeth, and whiles againſt the knowledge, whereby God hath inlightned his own mind.</p>
            <p>In this inſuing treatiſe perſons are ſpared and ſundry things hieroglyphically and ſummarily ſet down which muſt bring to readers leſſe acquainted with theſe matters ſome obſcuritie, but be not offended. Soberly and quietly peace is ſought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preiudice of any perſon or purpoſe, ſo farre as the clearing of the truth may ſuffer. You haue here to remember that old caution propounded by a Father to the Emperour, <hi>Take away the perill of the ſtatute,</hi> &amp;c. It is permitted to the maintainers of novelties, to uſe a continued, plentifull, and running ſpeech, which here is not to be found. For if the entiſing ſpeeches of mans wiſedome were true tokens of wiſedome indeed, the ſwallowes as they are ſwifter, may juſtly bee ſayd to bee aboue man in wiſedom. <hi>Paul</hi> for the truth is rude in ſpeaking, his preſence weak, &amp; his ſpeech contemptible. But <hi>Tertullus</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt him in a mask of eloquence, is admired for his pompous ſtile.</p>
            <p>The matters in queſtion every where are ſo backed with all,
<pb facs="tcp:21547:9"/>
meanes of credit in the hands of the one partie, and ſo borne down by vehement cries in the weaknes of the other. Mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on having now turned up-ſide-down, that where before the truth had favour to be ſpoken &amp; heard without fear. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies now a man muſt needs lay his hand upon his care for hearing the partie abſent, or fall in folly and ſhame to anſwer a matter before he hath heard it. The truth is not to be meaſured by the means of them that ſpeak for it, and all calumnies are but ſwines fleſh, though they be dreſſed after a divers faſhion. The cauſe in controverſie wronged by the violence of the time, may juſtly complaine of <hi>impar congreſsus</hi> in reſpect of worldly helpes in the particulars following, and many moe. The new courſe hath the countenance of the world: But it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with the ancient profeſſion, as with the Goſpell it ſelfe; <hi>Haue any of the rulers beleeved in him.</hi> Excepting alwayes the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Peeres of the land, whoſe loue is more large then their credit. 2. The moſt part of the ancient miniſters &amp; profeſſors, are removed either out of this life, or out of their former mind, and many out of their places, and ſuch as ariſe up, and are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the miniſterie, muſt ſweare &amp; ſubſcribe to maintaine and defend privatly and publickly the alterations inforced. 3. There is very few to be found having courage for the truth, to honor God with their credit &amp; riches: ſuch receiue the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell with a proviſion of ſafetie to their own eſtate, &amp; the poore who receive the Goſpell, are willing, but not able both to doe and ſuffer for the truth. 4. The pations and proctours of this new plea are richly rewarded with a fat b nefice, or great ſume of the taxation and benefic s promiſed: but the defenders are ready to be reſpected with <hi>Depriue</hi> and <hi>Confine. 5.</hi> They haue a ſtrong aſſiſtance, but the other are few &amp; weak, and if they be permitted to remain in their places, they are tied to the daily pains of their callings, and ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of their families; and if they be thruſt forth, they are forced to provide for their owne neceſſities, having no time for theſe matters, but ſtolne houres. 6. The one partie hath libertie to meet with full help of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite meanes, few or many, where and when, at their owne pleaſure. The other if two or three of them meet upon their
<pb facs="tcp:21547:9"/>
lawfull affaires, it is a ſcandall of Conventicle, &amp; a matter of chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge. 7 They are judges of their own cauſe, and haue at their right hand the power of Kirk and policie; but the cauſe of the other is like the widow &amp; the fatherleſſe, no man will heare it. 8 To them all the Preſſes are open and expenſes furniſhed: Printers beyond ſea are troubled upon ſuſpicion of having the copies of the other. 9 Their aſſertions are probations: the contrary cauſe acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for a found truth in ſecret, is in publick reſpected as an errour. 10 Threatned dangers maketh men afrayed to reade, write or print in favours of the one; all may be done to the advancement of the other with great commendation. 11 For loue of peace and lack of meanes, neceſſary purpoſes, as the anſwer to a rabble of untruthes known to a many yet living, hatched by <hi>Joan Fani Andrea Arch ep,</hi> and favoured with a latine complexion of ſome deſpiſed Doctor, and idle for lack of patients, and preſented to the world under the triumphing title, <hi>Refutatio libelli de regimine Eccleſiae Scoticanae.</hi> The anſwer to the Doctors, <hi>Lyndeſay, David Brechin,</hi> &amp; <hi>Michelſon,</hi> their bragging and begging pamphlets: The anſwer to Mercenary <hi>Tilen</hi> his pragmaticall paraeneſis &amp;c. are hid from the light, while neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie call for them.</p>
            <p>Finally, were there a change made of the proſperous caſe of the one cauſe with the adverſity of the other, or would the world but ſmile or frowne equally on both; they would not buſie the Printer and Reader ſo much. But the aequivalent of that old truth, <hi>poore Luther made many rich,</hi> is in ſome ſort verified in this cauſe: and that which preaching ſubſtance againſt Papiſts could not procure, pleading for ceremonies againſt Proteſtants hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. The Defenders haue no other comfort, but that they deliver their ſoules, diſcharge their conſciences and ſerue for witneſſes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ed with a crying conſcience for keeping it, and that will proue unpleaſant. Think not their labours like the circlings made by <hi>Archimedes,</hi> when <hi>Marcelius</hi> was on the ſea and nigh unto the ports of Syracuſe, except thou remember alſo that by his weake
<pb facs="tcp:21547:10"/>
meanes the Citie was a long time defended againſt the Roman ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, albeit at albeit laſt with the loſſe of his life. Neither be thou over vviſe to ſay, they might haue been like the good Geographers, who ſeldome trouble themſelues with the deſcription of ſmal Brooks, but waite on till by confluence they make great rivers, and are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdened into ſea. For had the riverets either been dryed up in time, or yet were drained in ſeverall chanels, the maine ſtreame would not ſwell ſo big, nor the great Whore, that ſitteth upon many waters proue ſo ſtately amongſt us. Onely firſt, for ſtirring up thy own ſoule, think with thy ſelfe how like the times of our Kirk may prooue unto the darkeneſſe of the ninth Centurie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, which the Centuriatours obſerue to haue proceeded of foure pregnant cauſes: 1 the exceſſiue loue of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ns writtes with the neglect of Scripture: 2 the praeeminence of ſome perſons aboue others: 3 the multiplication of ceremonies and humane inventions: 4 perſecution and oppreſſion of the moſt ſound in heart and judgement. Secondly, for judging of the Defenders part, conſider that howſoever they be commanded to loue ſuch as hate them, and pray for ſuch as perſecute them, yet how ſmall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they haue to beleeue that they who perſecute them, thinke that in ſo doing they doe God good ſervice. And thirdly, for thy own reſolution, remember that the ſentence of Chriſts throne, and the voyces of men in the world are farre different. Thy times and wayes are in the Lords hands. Set thy ſelfe in his preſence; view the courſe as it began, proceeded, hath been reſiſted, ſhould be refuſed, and may end, and ſee whether it ſhall be any griefe or offence of heart unto thee on that day, that thou haſt kept thy ſelfe in the loue of the truth from the beginnings of defection, the end whereof no fleſh can ſee, and every heart may juſtly feare that it ſhall be beyong Engliſh Conformity, in ſo farre as their lukewarm neſſe hath been towards the hot, and ours is after it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cold. The Lord giue wiſedome in all things.

                  <p>I Begin no ſooner to think upon the progreſſe of my ſhort time in the Miniſterie, but I remember of the Students of Athens, who the firſt yeare were wiſemen, the ſecond yeare Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, onely lovers of wiſedome; the next year Rhetoricians, no better then babblers; and the laſt yeare Idiots. At the firſt I ſeemed ſomewhat to others, and more then ſomewhat to my ſelfe; like many in theſe times, at whoſe blind boldneſſe, out of mine own experience, I would ſmile, were it not a ſubject of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. But afterward the Lord in his great mercie, opening my eyes to ſee, and touching my heart to bluſh at my owne inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie and naughtineſſe, I began to denie my ſelfe, to unſecret my ſoule to you: and at the firſt poured out all my former phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies and preſent thoughts into your boſome. At which time my reverend <hi>Epaphras,</hi> I received happie information, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be that indeed, which I was before in appearance; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times ſince haue I beene with great delight, exerciſed with you in heavenly contemplations for the furtherance of Gods work: But now my harp, with <hi>Iobs,</hi> is turned to mourning, and my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan into the voice of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that weep.

Some like <hi>Haman</hi> when the letters of revenge were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed againſt <hi>Mordecai</hi> and his people; ſome like the Iſraelites when they ſate down to eat and drink and roſe up to play; Others like the Iewes themſelues when they were in perplexitie &amp; great ſorrow: The fourth ſort equalling the firſt in miſerie of ſcene-ſerving ſycophants, who finding the religion before them, and not within them, are readie to ſerue God or the divel, as the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie will.<note place="margin">Three things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded con ern ng conformitie</note> And finally ſome ſo petted and <hi>empacque,</hi> that they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend both their judgement &amp; practiſe, till they ſee which ſide ſhall prevaile. As therefore I never went from your ſocietie but either wiſer or better, ſo muſt I now in my great need, importune you for my comfort and quietneſſe of my minde, to giue me ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction in theſe three particulars, all linked in one chaine. Firſt, out of your old experience; what hath been the methode of this myſterie of iniquitie from our reformation to this time. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, out of your diligent obſervation, by what meanes, and after what manner paſt it in an Act in the late Parliament. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after concluſion paſt in Kirk and Parliament, out of your graue direction, what is to be done of us, eſpecially in the caſe of mans immediate oppoſition, of the Neceſſitie of Conformitie or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation: Promiſing for dutie to follow after you in the ſtraiteſt waies of paſſiue obedience, ſo farre as I finde truth going before you, and leaving the ſucceſſe with cheerefulneſſe, to his high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, who makes all things work together for good to them that loue him.</p>

And that there be no other Iuriſdiction Eccleſiaſticall acknowledged within this Realm other then that which is &amp; ſhal be within the ſame kirk, or that which flowes there from concerning the premiſſes.

                     <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> That they are againſt the honour of God and his Chriſt.</head>
                  <p>THe ſtanding for the maintenance of the kingdome of God, and, whom hee hath anointed his King upon his holy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, is to their honour; like as to ſlide from it and leaue it, to follow after the world, is againſt the honour of God and Chriſt. To hear the word of God and to do it, is the ſpecial honouring of God, &amp; of that great Paſtor of the ſheep the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: As by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary the rejecting of his word, and caſting it off behind their back is his diſhonour. And finally to build &amp; plant with God is to honour him, ſo to caſt down &amp; root out that, which by the Miniſterie of his notable ſervants he hath builded and planted is to his high diſhonor: But ſo it is, as I haue verified &amp; ſhown, that Biſhopricks makes men to ſlide away from the Kingdome of Chriſt, to leaue it, and follow the world, to reject his word and caſt it behind their back: And finally to caſt down and root out, that which Chriſts faithfull ſervants hath bigged and planted, even that ſincerity of the Goſpell &amp; freedom of the Kirk of Chriſt brought to ſuch perfection, and ſo well eſtabliſhed, &amp; left unto us by them: and ſo with the Scribes and Phariſes to ſeek the glory of men rather then of God, &amp; to ſeek honor one of another, and not to honour Chriſt nor to ſeek to be acceptable unto him.</p>
                  <p>And is it not, alas, a horrible diſhonouring of God, and the preaching of his bleſſed veritie &amp; vvord, to flatter men &amp; annoint their filthie fleſh with earthly honor, wealth &amp; ſenſualitie, to make Chriſts holy Miniſters to be loathed, ſclandered and evil ſpoken of. And as the Lord rebuked <hi>Eli</hi> the Prieſt &amp; his ſons, vvhoſe ſinnes vvere great before the Lord, in making men to abhorre the Lords Miniſters and offerings: Therfore the Lord threatned them by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> ſaying: <hi>Wherfore haue ye kicked againſt my ſacrifice &amp; my offrings which I commanded in my tabernacle, and honors thy children aboue me,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21547:32"/>
to make your ſelfe fit of the firſt fruits of all the offerings of my people Iſrael, wherefore the Lord God of Iſrael ſaith, I ſaid thy houſe and the houſe of thy fathers ſhould walke before me for ever: But now the Lord ſaith it ſhall not be ſo: for they that honour me I will honour, and they that deſpiſe me ſhall be deſpiſed. And now, O yee Prieſts,</hi> cryed <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, this commandement is for you, if ye will not heare it not conſider it in your heart to giue glorie unto my name, J will even ſend a curſe upon you, and will curſſe your bleſſings; yea, I haue curſed them alreadie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye doe not conſider it in your hearts. Behold I will corrupt your ſeed, and caſt dong upon your faces, even the dong of your ſolemne feaſts, and ye ſhall be like unto it: and yee ſhall know that I haue ſent this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement unto you, that my covenant which I haue made with Levi, might ſtand, ſaith the Lord of hoſts. My covenant was with him of life and peace and equitie, and he did turne many away from iniquitie. For the Prieſts lips ſhould preſerue knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth, for he is the meſſenger of the Lord of hoſts. But ye are gone out of the way, ye haue cauſed many to fall by the Law, ye haue broken the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Levi, ſaith the Lord of hoſts Therefore I haue alſo made you to be deſpiſed and vile before all the people, becauſe yee keep not my wayes.</hi>

                  <p>IS it not the Kings vveale &amp; honour to honour God, to loue, fear &amp; obey him, to be wiſe and learned, to ſerue God in fear, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in trembling, to kiſſe the Son leſt he be angry; to be a nurſ-father to the Kirk, to be an avenger of all breakers of Gods holy law and miſorders againſt his manifeſt word and truth: And in a vvord to raign in Chriſt, by Chriſt, and vvith Chriſt, &amp; againſt the ſinne that drawes him to the contrarie? Is it not the weale and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Maj. to hold himſelfe in the favour of God, &amp; that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent loue &amp; good eſtimation of all that feares God unfeignedly, &amp; loues the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by holding faſt that profeſſion of the ſincerity of the Goſpell, in doctrine &amp; diſcipline, wherof his H. &amp; Kingdome in this Iland namely, hath found comfort and profit, that all the godly this day triumphes in, all the vvicked envie, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope is aſtoniſhed with admiration, at that union of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes under one God and Chriſt, one King, one Faith, one Law, and under his Majeſtie advanced and highly lifted up throne, far aboue all Kings Throns in Chriſtendom, in this reſpect &amp; for this cauſe, namely that his Highnes was borne &amp; entred to reign at the light and ſinceritie of the Goſpel; hath reigned ſo long, ſo happily, ſo peaceable with the ſame; and he and his poſterity in hope and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21547:33"/>
good appearance holding faſt the ſame to reigne moſt bleſſedly even to that appearance of Chriſt the King of Kings from the heavens. Is it not his Majeſties weale and honour to ſtand faſt to that confeſſion of faith ſworne and ſubſcrived by his Highneſſe, for good example to his houſhold, eſtates and all his ſubjects, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in all languages, affixed as it were on the moſt high pillar in the great Theater of Europe, teſtifying and proclaiming to all, his Majeſties pietie, ſinceritie and zeale to the Goſpell of Chriſt and his Kingdome, againſt all corruption and thraldome of the Antichriſt of Rome? And againſt his weale and honour that leades him to the contrarie? Is it not the weale and honour of his Royall Majeſtie, to haue all the hearts of the moſt ſincere Proteſtants and profeſſors of the holy Evangell; not onely throughout great Brittaine, but alſo France, Germanie, Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Sweden, to be as it were the heart of one man, to ware all their bloud for his Majeſties ſafetie in perſon, encreaſe in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſtabilitie in eſtate; by holding faſt unaltered or mixed the ſincere ſimplicitie of the Goſpell, and doctrine, ſacraments and diſcipline, which they haue ſo long profeſſed with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, and againſt the which what curſed force or buſineſſe was ever able to prevaile unto this houre? And finally, is it not his Majeſties weale and honour to be ſafe and free from the falſhood, flatterie and crueltie of ambitious avarice, which hath brought ſo many notable Emperours, Kings and Princes to tragicall ends, corrupted ſincere Kirkes, and overthrowne flouriſhing Common-wealthes? And verily this venome and poyſon of humane Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, degenerating into Satanicall, hath filled the Eccleſiaſtical &amp; civill hiſtories full of ſuch effects, the ſmalleſt haire of root and pickle of ſeed is therefore to be fanned away and plucked out of all Kirkes, Kingdomes and Common-wealthes This the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſedome, quickneſſe of wit, prudence and ſagacitie of the King, who is as an Angell of God, can well marke, and take up a farre, both to beware of it where he hath found it, and can not well amend it, and not to permit to creep into the field ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and cleane purged therefrom. Thus paſſing over the impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Kings patrimonie, and many moe things againſt his Highneſſe weale and honour, for brevities ſake I end this point, not doubting but his Majeſtie is alwaies mindfull of that decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſo clearely, godly and eloquently penned &amp; ſubſcribed by his Highneſſe own hands, at his Majeſties Parliament holden at Linlithgow in December 1585. The concluſion whereof is moſt worthie of remembrance at this time, for that by forgetting that, theſe who ſeek Epiſcopall dignitie ſeekes the hurt and diſhonour of his moſt renowmed Majeſtie. <hi>Then ſhortly to end this my decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,

                  <p>ITt is an Axiom approved in Experience and Policie. <hi>Quod om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis mutatio Reipub. eſt periculoſa etiamſi in melius,</hi> how much more <hi>in deterius.</hi> The reaſon then holdeth thus. All dangerous things for the eſtate and common-wealth are to bee eſchewed: But change is dangerous, namely from ſuch an eſtate, which is conforme to the word of God, good Lawes and Conſtitutions, the judgement of the holieſt and beſt learned, ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne, the beſt eſtate of the Primitiue Kirk, and beſt reformed Kirkes from corruption of Papiſtrie, to an eſtate plaine contrarie, and ſo moſt perverſe and pernicious. For let Lawyers and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques reaſon and judge the civill part for the eſtate of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, we dare boldly conclude, as we haue evidently proved, that it is pernicious for the Kirk of Ieſus Chriſt: And that which is pernicious thereto can never ſtand with the good eſtate of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kingdome and godly Common-wealth. It is ſo cleare in the Hiſtories, and miſerable experience of theſe laſt Ages of the would that it needs no probation, being acknowledged and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by all Proteſtants, that the Popiſh Hierarchie and uſurpation of both the ſwords, hath brought the Romane Empire, and all Kingdomes and Commonwealths in Europe that haue not reſiſted the ſame, to abominable and moſt filthie ſervitude and ſlaverie, in their goods, bodies &amp; ſoules. And thoſe who haue caſt off the yoke of that bondage, and reſiſted thereunto haue been involved in bloudie battels, and had great fear &amp; adoe to keep them ſafe from the moſt craftie and cruel practiſes of that peſtilent throne of kirk ambition &amp; avarice.

And if one will aske how ſhall theſe Biſhops be more ſubiect to be carried after the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of an evill prince, then the reſt of the eſtates. The anſwer and reaſon is, becauſe they haue their Lordſhip and living, their honour, eſtimation, profit and commoditie of the King by others. The King may ſet them vp, and caſt them downe, give them and take from them, put them in and out at his pleaſure. And therefore they muſt bee at his direction to doe what liketh him, and in a word, he may doe with them by law, becauſe they are ſet vp againſt law: but with other eſtates hee cannot doe ſo, they having either heritable ſtanding in their roomes by the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall lawes, or then but a commiſſion from the eſtate that ſend them, as from the Burgeſſes or Barones.

                  <p>HOwbeit that this be cleare enough of all that haue been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the chapters preceding, yet particularizing the ſame, we will make it more cleare. Wee call them good Scottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that have a true ſence of the honour of God, love of their Chriſt, care of the ſinceritie of the Goſpell, and libertie of his Kirke, a feeling of the need of their ſoules, a hunger and thirſt for righteouſneſſe, and that word of life which is the food therof, and therewithall a loue of their natiue countrey, of the freedome and weale of the ſame. Now this Biſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For if there ariſe a Popiſh or prophane Prince, they muſt alter with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m, and pleaſe and obey him, or tyne their places, their honours, their riches and pleaſures, the which they will not doe, becauſe they have already given their conſciences, honeſtie, truth and credit before God and man, as a price for theſe things of the world. And put caſe true religion ſtand, what care will they haue of feeding of ſoules, who haue ſold their owne for the world. All their care and travell muſt bee to keep their Court, pleaſe the King, acquire and conſerve more plentie of goods, honour and pleaſures. And they being thus ſet and given, their inferiour mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for the moſt part will follow their faſhions, ſo there ſhall bee nothing amongſt men but atheiſme, licentiouſneſſe and profanitie. For as concerning diſcipline, it being put into the hands of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, they will make merchandiſe of it, or let the reines thereof looſe in favour of this or that great man, or of one Courteor or other, as hath ever been the nature and cuſtome of theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Biſhops to be men pleaſers, and hunters after the favour and friendſhip of the world, not daring to diſpleaſe or adhere unto the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof upon others, leaſt it ſhould ſtrike upon themſelues commonly more guiltie and ſlanderous then any other. And thus the true worſhip of God, and care of the ſalvation of ſoules, ſhall utterly periſh, Next, I call them good Scottiſh men, who haue a care and loue of the libertie of their countrey, and of their bodies to liue as free men therein in ſafetie and good health. But ſo it is this Biſhoprie will bring the countrey, the lawes, the priviledges thereof with the bodies of men in ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21547:36"/>
ſervitude and riotous diſſolution, which breedes mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold diſeaſes, diſtruction and death of body. For if any ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Prince pleaſe to play the tyrant, and governe all not by lawes, but by his will and pleaſure, ſignified by miſſiues, articles, and directions, theſe Biſhops ſhall never admoniſh him as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full paſtors and meſſengers of God (for that they are not, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no lawfull calling nor authoritie from God and his kirk) but as they are made up by man, they muſt and will flatter, pleaſure and obey men. And as they ſtand by affection of the Prince, ſo will they by no meanes jeopard their ſtanding, but be the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all to put the Kings will and pleaſure in execution; and it were to take and apprehend the bodies of the beſt, and ſuch name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as would ſtand for the lawes and freedome of the Realme, and caſt them in dark and ſtinking priſons, put them in exile from their natiue land, &amp;c. Attour &amp; beſides this, vnleſſe that men of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever eſtate or ranke they be, cap and kneele to them, give them their ambitious ſtiles, places and ſalutations, ſlaviſhly abuſing their bodies againſt their hearts, they ſhall not miſſe their indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be intereſt, and croſſed, and wronged in their ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Laſt, their companie and entertainment will be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ryot and exceſſe, whereto that Biſhoprie is much given. And if thus the Realme, the lawes and priviledges therof, and the perſons of good Scotiſhmen may be uſed, it is eaſie to gather the like of their goods and geare. The Biſhop in his owne citie, and among his vaſſals, will thinke himſelfe a pettie Roy, vvho dare deny to lend, to give, to ſerve them, with whatſoever they haue? or if they doe deny, can they not and their Lawyers, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtiques, Dependaries, deviſe the way how to get him to the Horne, or into ſome inconvenience and danger of the law, and then their whole goods and eſtate falling into the Biſhops hands, they ſhall bee pilled and polled ſickerly, The pittifull experience in times paſt, makes us bold to give the warning for the time to come: for it hath been ſeen and felt, and yet day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is in this Iland. And finally, it is already too manifeſt, that if the Prince bee prodigall, or would inrich his Courtiers by taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, impoſts, ſubſidies and exactions layd upon the ſubject, of the Realme, who have been, or ſhall bee ſo ready to conclude and impoſe that by parliament, as theſe who are made and ſet up for that and the like ſervice. And whatſoever become of the poore tenents and labourers by land or ſea, they ſhall bee ever winners by that block and butie.</p>
                  <p>Then to conclude, ſeeing this Biſhoprie, as wee have clearly &amp; evidently ſhown and verified, is againſt the written word of God,

Much time and talk being ſpent about theſe demands, and ſome boaſtings to daſh the miniſters being breathed out, but no cleare anſwer returned, two queſtions were confuſedly caſt in. 1 Whether the moderators of aſſemblies ſhould bee conſtant or circular (as they tearmed it.) 2 Whether ſhould the caveats be keeped or not.

To the ſecond, that the caveats were acts of the generall aſſembly, ſuch as they muſt ſtand unrepealed for a good uſe, viz. for reſtraining the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of voters in parliament in name of the kirk, and in that reſpect no more to be called in queſtion then any other act concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that vote.

What the Kirk of Chriſt hath loſſed, as much hath Antichriſt gained; he needs not to feare the fead of Diſcipline and Kirk Aſſemblies, nor the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient unitie of vigilant Paſtors, for by the Circaean cup of this mightie mutation the face of matters, and faſhions of men are ſo metamorphoſed, that perhaps you ſhall find, that he vvho loved you beſt and hated the adverſaries and corrupters of Religion moſt, is changed quite from himſelfe, and ſcarſly can ye know your old friend now walking in his new cut: our <hi>old one heart</hi> is now <hi>either heart and heart,</hi> or elſe <hi>no heart at all.</hi> We vvere vvont to cloſe up our great controverſies vvith heartie harmonie: now in common matters we hirſp like harp and harrovv.

Thus Chriſt tryeth his own Kirk; Antichriſt hath eſcaped vvith his crueltie and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and hath gotten as many yeares of peace to prepare his laſt onſet by ſubtiltie, as the Kirk hath of troubles to make her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations againſt his battels.

                  <p>The ſecond vvay was as skilfull, but not ſo ſucceſſefull as the firſt. Vpon ſome queſtion of place betwixt two Lords of Parliament, both lovers of Religion, it was apprehended that they would rather looſe their votes, then perill their dignity: And therefore ſtrait commandement was given to Noble men to keep their own places. But as that worthy Grecian with his fellow-ambaſſadour buried their private emulations till their return, when the publicke affaires of the common-wealth were exped; ſo they perceiving the ſnare, packed up the controverſie for that time, and of their Chriſtian diſcretion, and generous affection, preferring a ſubſtantiall duety to a circumſtantial ceremony kept their liberty, and ſo diſappointed that policie. And as the firſt policie of this ſort perſwaded ſome to leaue the Town, ſo the ſecond vvould haue moved others to leaue their riding. But on the other ſide I vvill tell you by the way that their policie could not make all to be preſent of vvhoſe concurrence they aſſured themſelues. Divine providence in one example might haue been a ſufficient inſtruction to let them ſee, how eaſily his Majeſtie might haue tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all their purpoſes and counſels to folly, if it had beene his pleaſure, for that which befell one might haue befallen the reſt.

After this confirmation, the Lord Commiſſioner addeth the confutation: for againſt the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion &amp; ſurmiſe, that his Maieſtie was reſolved to make this kirk in all things conforme to the Church of England; he did aſſume that his Ma. willed him to ſignifie unto them, that theſe being once concluded, he would urge no other rite nor ceremonie, and that by their according to theſe, they would give ſingular declaration of their loyalty; and therfore requeſted to take heed how they voted.</p>

                  <p>In the concluſion,<note place="margin">Threefold confuſion in voting.</note> when the matter is brought to the voters of the houſe, there was a threefold well ſtudied confuſion: firſt albeit the fiue articles were different in themſelus, and the moſt part had different opinions concerning them; yet they were all hudled up in one bundell according to the practick &amp; ſucceſſe at Perth, that all of them might carry the ſavour of any one that was leaſt reſiſted, and then every one the moſt miſliked of them the favour of all. The ſame skill was uſed in ioyning the ordinary and extraordinary taxation: for divers of every eſtate thought hardly of the extraordinary taxation, all being moſt willing to giue large ſupply in the ordinary, anſwerable to the grat affaires in hand, and honour of the kingdome. And therefore upon aſſurance, that it would be refuſed by no man, the other was ſtraitly tied to it. Secondly, advantage was taken of the conceived words, <hi>Agree and diſagree</hi> the preſcribed form of voting: for all being ſtraitly diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged here as at Perth, to give any reaſon for their votes, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion might paſſe <hi>ad numerum non ad vondus;</hi> or leaſt the weight ſhould be prejudicial to the number, &amp; all directed to expreſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſimply in theſe words, it come to paſſe, that the ſecond ſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Diſagree</hi> through the wide opening of the mouth at A, did eat up the firſt, eſpecially in the low pronounciation of ſome, who being deſired to ſpeak out, threatnings and boaſtings vvith me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thirdly, in calling the roll and marking the votes, the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the three ſeverall eſtates was ſuppreſſed, and all who had power to vote, were called promiſcuouſly as ſo many ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that the concluſion might be made up by pluralitie of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall voters, without reſpect na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to their corporations; whereas the Barrowes, one of the eſtates diſagreed directly; and the other eſtate rightly conſidered, as it conſiſteth of greater &amp; leſſer Barons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture of officials of eſtate; and abſents made preſent by their procurators, would haue made that eſtate doubtſome, if not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue; and ſo all the preceeding diligence from Perth aſſembly to this houre notwithſtanding, the act of ceremonies had ſound no other father at this time, except the Eſtate of Biſhop, with others of equall engagement; as it will ſtil proue frowen faced as long as it is fathered upon others vvho begat it againſt their vvills; let men reioyce at the birth thereof, and busk it up as they pleaſe.</p>

                  <p>I know that the providence of God ruleth, and the fin of man procureth all judgements and afflictions. And (I thank my God) I haue learned againſt the Atheiſme of the times ſome rules to direct me how to reduce particular judgements to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular cauſes, and to father them right upon their owne deſerving ſinnes. As 1 by denunciation in the word, vvhen I find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a particular judgement threatned againſt a particular ſinne, I muſt confeſſe that I am become ſo ſimple, that I aſcribe the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when it falleth out to that ſin as the proper cauſe: 2 by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation; vvhen the judgement is ſo like to the ſinne that the ſin appeareth in the judgement as in a mirrour: 3 by propagation, vvhen ſinne in the own nature bringeth forth ſuch a judgement as the birth thereof: 4 by accuſation when the conſcience upon the comming of the judgement immediately remembreth and convinceth of the ſame ſinne: 5 by deprehenſion, vvhen the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:21547:67"/>
is taken in the verie act, as a thiefe with the fang. When ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or all of theſe rules concurre in one particular, they leaue no ſcruple of dubitation in my heart, whether the matter concerne my owne perſonall caſe, or the common eſtate of the Kirk, or Weale-publick. And I doubt nothing, but men ſeparating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for that end, might Savanorolalike, by the grace of God diſpoſing them to joyne in their obſervation the courſe of the vvord and vvorkes of God, know much more of the procuring and intended cauſes of the judgements of God, and learne more of him vvho is known by executing judgements then they doe. But to prevent all miſtaking my deſire is not ſo much for the preſent to make particular application of my rules to that vvhich you haue related as to haue ſatisfaction to the third of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands according to my propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Third De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</note> and your promiſe in the beginning.</p>

Even as many ſtay their mindes, ſo farre as they can, from thinking that to bee true, which they vviſh were falſe. They cannot doe a thing unlawful, but they can judge a thing unlawfull to be indifferent, and ſo doe a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. Others there bee, vvho bring on their mindes by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.

At laſt the Lord giveth them over to Atheiſme in opinion, that they ſay in their hearts, <hi>There is not a God.</hi> So may I ſay of Adiaphoriſme, and iudging of indifferencie, many at the firſt are brought to practiſe without conſideration. Afterward finding themſelves wrong, but either for feare of ſhame or skaith, refuſing to follow the retrait of their conſcience, they wiſh in affection that they were not matters of faith.

The firſt ſort toucheth the life and ſoule of Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and thus the Articles of the Creed are accounted matters of faith. The ſecond is of their neceſſarie attendants, by cleare and undenyable conſequence following the former at the heeles: ſo that no man perſwaded of the former firſt principles, can haue any heſitation almoſt concerning theſe. And the third is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all things revealed in Scripture concerning whatſoever purpoſe although moſt indifferent in it ſelfe. There is nothing of ſo meane importance written in the word, but it muſt bee ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked among the matters of faith, how ſoone it is manifeſted to bee of divine authoritie.

And that he who after conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion denieth the conſequent, denieth the antecedent. The Iew making confeſſion, vvith the fathers, of his faith in the Meſſiah, but denying that the Meſſiah is come, doth indeed deny the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah.

And hence it is manifeſt that the determination of the Scripture could not poſſible be more particular vvithout ſuperfluity. This is the perfection of that wiſedom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it hath neither defect nor exceſſe; that it neither wanteth any thing poſſible, nor hath any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. It is commanded that the Paſtor ſhall preach to the people, but whether he ſhall ſtand on his head or his feet, with his face or his back turned toward them, in a high or a low pulpit, it is left to the light of nature: That Baptiſme be miniſtred with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but as the vvater of Iudaea had been impoſſible, ſo it vvas un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to determine with vvhat vvater: That the Lords Supper be celebrate in bread and wine, but as the bread and vvine of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea vvas impoſſible, ſo the light of nature directs whence vve ſhall haue them. The determination of the time and houre vvas not poſſible, and may be known by naturall reaſon but the geſture is determined, and albeit it had not been expreſſed, it followeth upon the table.</p>

Now the light of nature vvill never teach any to kneele in the time of eating and drinking at the Lords Table, but rather to uſe a Table-geſture. Nor can the light of nature giue a reaſon why the 25 of December ſhould be obſerved, except it be pretended to be the birth day, which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently falſe, or becauſe it is a fit time for feaſting, which is both profane and ſenſuall.</p>

And therfore kneeling vvith the reaſon vvhereupon it is concluded, cannot bee a matter indifferent, but neceſſary to bee practiſed by all communicants in all times and places. And obſervation of dayes is of the ſame ſort: for were it a thing indifferent, then one kirk vvould make choyce of one time for inſtructing of the people in the naitivitie, and another kirk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time.<note place="margin">Vniformitat in majoribus caeremon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Ye ſay then in ſumme, that a good man doth that which is good or indifferent, in the beſt manner, to a good end. All foure may be brought unto two, <hi>Bonum</hi> good, and <hi>Bene</hi> well. Becauſe no man but a good man can doe an action well with due regard of the circumſtances, and the end. If it be neither <hi>bonum</hi> good, nor <hi>bene</hi> well, it is neither with the Holy Ghoſt, nor of the Holy Ghoſt. If it be <hi>bonum</hi> good, and not <hi>bene</hi> well, as the good workes of naturall or civill men; it is of the Holy ghoſt, but not with the holy Ghoſt. If it be <hi>Bene</hi> well and not <hi>Bonum</hi> good, it is with the Holy Ghoſt, but not of the Holy Ghoſt. But if it be <hi>bonum</hi> good and <hi>bene</hi> well, it is both with and of the holy Ghoſt.</p>

Secondly, as everie ſcandall is ſinne, <hi>Paſſiue</hi> in the patient, <hi>Actiue</hi> in the agent, and mixt in both; ſo ſcandall actiue or given, hath place not onely in things vnlawfull, but indifferent. <hi>Bleſſed is bee that condemneth not himſelfe in that which hee alloweth.</hi> Rom. 14. And that which is mixt ſcandall commeth neereſt to the nature of actiue; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or never can there bee a publick ſcandall taken, except it bee alſo actiue and given. Seeing there muſt bee offences, not onely by neceſſitie of Gods decree, of Satans malice, of mans corruption, of the end, that the Kirke may bee tried, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by neceſſitie of the object, that is, of the infirme and weake, vvho cannot keepe themſelues from ſtumbling, vvhen the rocke lieth in the way; all occaſions of taking of offence ought to be removed and prevented. Otherwiſe <hi>Ezekias</hi> might haue ſuffered the braſen Serpent to ſtand, the ſcandall vvhereof was onely taken
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:21547:89"/>
But had he ſuffered, farre more had he ordained it by law to ſtand after the abuſe, the ſcandall had been mixt, and more actiue then paſſiue. Thirdly, ſcandall is given not onely in <hi>intentione operantis,</hi> in the intention of the doer: but alſo <hi>negligente operante in conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne operis,</hi> the doer being negligent in the qualitie of the deed. Not onely that perſon giveth ſcandall amongſt us, vvho by the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies would reduce Poperie, or ſymbolize with the Papiſts, or knoweth them to be dangerous: but he alſo vvho not knowing or fearing danger, yeeldeth to practiſe them, and that <hi>propter conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem operis,</hi> by reaſon of the qualitie of the deed.

Our owne late act of Parliament (not unlike that ancient law of Millane remembred by <hi>Sigonius</hi>) for preventing of fire in the Towne of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh, is a ſtrong confutation of the firſt act.

                  <p>To tell you my mind, I acknowledge an eſſentiall kirk, the Congregation of the faithfull, a repreſentatiue Kirk, the Aſſembly repreſenting the Kirk eſſentiall. But I know no virtuall Kirk on earth: whether the Biſhop of Rome, or any other man, as having in himſelfe eminently and virtually (for ſo the Papiſts profeſſe, and others in part practiſe) ſuch certainty of truth, and ſoveraignty of judgement, that he may command what he will in any controverted matter Eccleſiaſticall, whether he command that which is unlawfull, or that which is lawfull to be done in an unlawfull manner, that is againſt the generall rules. When <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great came to Ieruſalem he deſired his image to be ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Temple. The high Prieſt was willing to pleaſe him in every thing, wherein God was not diſpleaſed: and therfore refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with all reverence that idolatry, what he might, and what ſerved more the Kings honour he offered cheerefully. Firſt, to beginne the accounts of their times from his entry into Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: and ſecondly, to name all their firſt borne ſonnes <hi>Alexanders</hi> from him. What is civill, what domeſtick, what is <hi>Caſars,</hi> what is ours, let them be forbidden water and fire, and their Citie ſowne with ſalt who refuſe it. Let Chriſts royall prerogatiue who will not giue his glory to another be kept for himſelfe. May we not in ſo narrow a ſtrait, where we can ſee no way to turne, neither to the right hand nor to the left, open our mouthes with the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Aſſe, and ſay, <hi>Haue we uſed to ſerue ſo in other matters?</hi>

If it be that all things may be more decent, what can be more decent then the ſimplicity of Christ? What more ſimple then his decency? If it be for fulfilling of his owne will let it be ſo.

                  <p>That is not my part ye know: yet this I may ſay, that as in the matter of hereſie; ſo in time of ſchiſme for matters of ceremonie, the Magiſtrate calleth a Synode repreſenting the whole Kirk, having power definitiue and the judgement of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction according to the vvord.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21547:91"/>
of the ſoule at the commandement of the will, as the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ponder and conſider, the appetite to exerciſe temperance, fortitude &amp;c. and out of her deſire and choice of the ſoveraigne good of ſoule and bodie, ſetteth all the powers of ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to worke: Even ſo the Magiſtrate hath <hi>actum elicitum</hi> in civill affaires, his eſſentiall and moſt proper object: in the matters of Gods Kirk whether for order or juriſdiction, albeit he hath not <hi>actum elicitum,</hi> he may neither preach the word nor miniſter the Sacraments, not define by himſelfe regularly: yet he hath <hi>actum imperatum:</hi> he may command miniſters to preach the word, to celebrate the Sacraments, and to convene and determine accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Word.</p>

                  <p>I wiſh it were ſo indeed. The more learned of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts make three ſort of ceremonies: ſome to be the efficient cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of grace, as the Sacraments: ſome to remoue the impediments of grace, as the ſigne of the croſſe, holy water &amp;c: and ſome to ſerue for comelyneſſe and order. They confeſſe that the Kirk hath no power to inſtitute ceremonies of the firſt ſort, but of the ſecond and third onely. Againe, the Defenders of our ceremonies ſtand onely for the third ſort in word, but agree indeed with the Papiſts, as appeareth two wayes. 1 They take in under the name of rites, for order and decency, many of the ſecond ſort of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ceremonies, vvhich the Papiſts make forcible to remoue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments. And whatſoever is pretended, it is well enough known of the Croſſe, Surplice, Holydaies &amp;c. that they are ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly uſed, vvhereſoever they haue place; and more aſcribed to them then to Chriſts own Ordinances. 2 Vnder the name of rites ſerving for decency and order, they take in all ſuch ceremonies, as they thinke may adde or lend ornament unto the worſhip of God, as is manifeſt out of the doctrine and very definitions of things indifferent,<note place="margin">

For perſons bearing office in the kirke, no nation, nor tribe, nor family could be deſigned more then another, <hi>Quod eſt à re non à voluntate legiſlatoris.</hi> Yet the diſtinction of the bounds belonging to everie ſynagogue, vvas left to the power of the kirk of the Iewes, no leſſe then the diſtinction of Pariſhes now to the Chriſtian kirke; and all the diſtinct office-bearers are preſcribed now as well as then. As unlawfull now to bring in a new kinde of miniſterie into the kirke, as it vvas at that time; and will prove in the end to be no better then ſtrange fire. 2.

For times, in vindicating his feſtivall dayes from the blame of Iudaiſme; he denieth that the kirk hath power to make dayes like the Iewiſh dayes, in appropriating a vvorſhip to them,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21547:94"/>
vvhich is not lawfull to performe another day: but ſeemeth to ſlip in two things. 1. that hee giveth power to the kirke to make dayes as holy as that day, vvhich is more holy then the Iewiſh dayes, putting no difference of holineſſe betwixt the Sabboth and the dayes appointed by the kirk; but maketh all the difference to be divine inſtitution. As D. <hi>Downame</hi> precept. 4. addeth to the vveekly Sabboths all other Sabboths lawfully ordained by the kirk, <hi>All which are to bee conſecrated</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>as Sabboths to the Lord.</hi> And for example of Sabboths lawfully ordained, he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the feaſts of Chriſts Nativitie, Reſurrection, &amp;c. giving power to the kirk to make Sabboths, like Gods Sabboths. 2. He ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth in his appropriations; of the two ſorts of it he ſtriveth to remoue the one, that is, the appropriation of the worſhip to the day, albeit he knoweth that it would not be counted lawfull to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize the feaſt of the Nativitie, Reſurrection, &amp;c. upon other dayes; the ſolemne remembrance of theſe benefites being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vvorſhip of the dayes, and not the inſtruction of the people in the grounds of the Catechiſme. The ſolemne vvorſhip of the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, Pentecoſt, and Tabernacles, was appropriated to the owne times, yet it vvas lawfull to inſtruct the people in the knowledge of the benefites at other times. The other appropriation of the day to the vvorſhip, he paſſeth vvith ſilence, as that it made not a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daicall difference of dayes When I ſay, it is not lawfull to exerciſe that vvorſhip another day, and to exerciſe another vvorſhip that day, I make difference of dayes both wayes. As I doe of meates, vvhen I ſay out of a religious diſtinction of meats, I will eat any meat except that; and no other meat but that. Had it beene the Lords will that his people ſhould haue kept anniverſarie and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie feaſts, ſeeing they were no leſſe poſitiue, &amp; might haue been as eaſily determined as the weekly Sabboths, he had not paſſed them vvithout determination. Finally, all that he hath ſet down concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning order, is no more determined in the kirk of the Iewes, then in the Chriſtian kirk: as vvherat, and how the Prieſt or Levit ſhould begin, proceed, cloſe, Pſalmes, praying, reading, preaching; what petition to bee proponed, circumciſion in ſtead of baptiſme, the paſſover in place of the communion, marriage and all things in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, diſcipline and divine ſervice.

                  <p>There be two ſorts of Eccleſiaſtick ceremonies, ſome are determinable by a generall law throughout the Chriſtian world, or vniverſal kirk; al which are determined in the word, &amp; therfore are neceſſarie; ſome again are national, temporall, local, individual, &amp;c. left to the determination of particular kirks, according to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rules, and therfore changeable, as is contained in the article. 2. there is a twofold convenience of ceremonies, according to the foreſaid two kinds of ceremonies, the one eſſentiall, the other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall; the one is internall or intrinſecall from divine inſtitution, the other external framed to circumſtances. Now let him who hath moſt hardned his heart in that courſe, judge betwixt him and God, whether the one conveniencie or the other be meant, vvhen ſitting is judged to be moſt convenient: ſeeing it is not ſayd <hi>moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> without any further, or moſt convenient to the times, or to the preſent conſtitution of the kirk, as the Biſh. vvould haue it, vvhile he boaſteth of this ſo often, ſaying, that which at one time is more convenient, at another time may be leſſe convenient. But it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſayd, <hi>Moſt convenient to the inſtitution,</hi> vvhich in all times &amp; places is the ſame, neither can there be any thing moſt convenient to the inſtitution at one time in one place, &amp; not moſt convenient at another time in another place.

In reaſoning and voting for the articles, no mention of reverence of religion, of reaſon, but frequent mention of authoritie. In the narratiue of the acts, never a word of authority, but of reverence, religion, reaſon. That paſtors &amp; people vvho either vvere not preſent, or ſhall ſucceed hereafter, looking upon the acts as they are conceived; may think that it was not humane, but divine authoritie, not violence but reaſon that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the concluſion. 2.

The matters he urged were but circumſtantiall, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and variable, and ſuch as the beſt Kings, having the Lords approbation, had changed before. They could ſay that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip vvas the ſame in ſubſtance, that they ſerved the ſame God who brought them out of Egypt, with the ſacrifices and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the ſtatutes kept by all the fathers ſince the beginning of the world. That their Bullockes, which Preciſians called idols were ſimilitudes repreſenting the onely ſacrifice of the Meſſiah in whom they looked for ſalvation. Were there not Cherubines in the Tabernacle and Temple, and twelu Oxen or Buls of braſſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the wiſeſt King? The Lord forbiddeth ſuch images onely as haue divine worſhip done unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; like the Calfe in the wildernes, turning the glory of God into the ſimilitude of a bullock that eateth graſſe. But they could ſay, that they worſhipped not theſe Calues more then the images of the Cherubines. Are we ſo groſſe when we ſay. <hi>Behold our Gods,</hi> as to think that they brought us out of Egypt? We ſpeake figuratiuely, as the Arke vvas called the <hi>King of Glorie,</hi> and <hi>the holy Lord God.</hi> Wee vvill rather giue our liues, lands, libertie and all, then commit Idolatry for the pleaſure of any Prince; and doe abhorre the abuſe of Images, vvhich is to bow down and ſerue them; albeit we be
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:21547:98"/>
not of that mind but we may haue them and worſhip God by them; becauſe we know no place of Scripture to the contrary. The place of worſhip is but a circumſtance; and to tie Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to any place, who is neere in all times and places to them that call upon him is ſuperſtition. The Arke was not ever in one place but often removed. In <hi>Salomons</hi> own time there was two publick places of Gods worſhip, and <hi>Salomon</hi> ſacrificed in them both. Is not the whole land holy? The promiſe made to <hi>Salomon</hi> of a ſpeciall preſence at Ieruſalem, was tyed to the condition of keeping his Statutes and Iudgements, wherein he hath failed. And therefore as his Throne is thrown down, which the Lord at the ſame time promiſed to eſtabliſh, ſo hath the place loſſed the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of holineſſe. We may plead from Antiquity: for heere is <hi>Bethel,</hi> ſo famous for that glorious teſtimony of his preſence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Iacob,</hi> from whom we this day haue the name of Iſrael. <hi>Rehoboam</hi> is no wiſer then his father, he may fall into his Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and ſo Iſrael by reſorting to Ieruſalem may be ſnared. All danger of Idolatry would be prevented, the poore people eaſed of their tedious journies, and both Prince and people ſaved from <hi>Rhehoboams</hi> conſpiracy. All this dinne and diviſion proceedeth of the humours of ſome contentious and avaritious Levits, ſeducing the ſimple people, making them to thinke that God cannot be ſerved but in Ieruſalem after their faſhion in every circumſtance and particular ceremony: and of the doting of ſome perſons of the weakeſt wit and ſex, delighting to goe abroad, to be talked of for zeale, and more pleaſed with any worſhip then that which they haue at home. The obſervation of the Feaſt of Tabernacles upon the 15 day of the 8 month, is but the change of a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time. The day was made for man, and not man for the day. It was lawfull by Gods own warrant to keep the Paſſeover on the 14 day of the ſecond month; he careth not for the month ſo the day be kept. It is preſumption to alter things ſubſtantiall in matters of faith or doctrine: but ſuperſtition to ſtand upon cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and variable ceremonies. What can be done, the Lords worſhip cannot be neglected. If the Prieſts of Levi make it nice, will ſtill proue contentious, and lead a faction with them for ſtrengthning the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> upon warrant of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, before the diſtinction of <hi>Levi</hi> was made for orders ſake, others of other Tribes, as vvell qualified as themſelues muſt be put in their places, and they put away as <hi>Abiathar</hi> was by <hi>Salomon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had his hand with <hi>Adoniiah.</hi> It may be vvhen they ſee their places well filled, and the charity of profuſe people, which cannot laſt long to decay, that their giddineſs goe away, and they returne to their right wits. The Prophet that came to the King

Abijah</hi> dyed not before his day. All things come alike to the godly and to the vvicked, to him that ſacrificeth and him that ſacrificeth not. Or if his death vvas untimous it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his ſecret intentions croſſing his fathers courſes, then for any good that was in him towards the God of Iſrael, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet would haue it.</p>

Although when trangreſſions are come to the full, the Lord raiſeth up men of a fierce countenance, and underſtanding darke ſentences, furniſhed in a time of defection, with gifts moſt fitting for deſtruction: The Lord ſhall notwithſtanding ſaue his own from their craft and cruelty, ſo farre as ſerues for their wiſhed bleſſedneſſe, ſhall poure out of his ſpirit upon his ſervants to giue teſtimony to his glorious truth in the midſt of perſecution: and ſhall make them able to diſcerne betwixt appearance and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, pretexts and reaſons, promiſes and purpoſes, ſucceſſe and conſcience, that they goe not blindfolded with the world to perdition.</p>
